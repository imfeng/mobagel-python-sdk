# mobagel-python-sdk

## Introduce

MoBagel is a real-time cloud analytics platform that helps IoT companies monitor and analyze hardware usage, speed up research and development, forecast sales and marketing strategies, and proactively engage with customers to prevent product returns. As a result, companies can also save up to millions in cost reductions.

## Installation

To run the example project, clone the repo, or run [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) install from the Example directory first.  
```shell
	$ pip install mobagel-python-sdk
```

## Getting Started

#### - Creating an account

If you do not have an account, please create an account [here](https://app.mobagel.com/signup). After you create an account, you will be directed to the dashboard.

#### - Creating a new product
To use MoBagel, you first have to create a **product**, which is essentially a group of same **devices**. You can create new products in the dashboard.

For example:

[Product Name] iBulb
[Product Brief] Smart light bulb
[Product Description] Wi-Fi connected light bulb with motion sensors and temperature sensors.
After you create a **product**, the system will generate a **product_key**, which will be used to create  **devices** later on.

#### - Register your first device
Once you generated a product_key from the dashboard, you can use the product_key and registerDevice function to register a device in your application.

	# Import package
	import pybagel

	product_key = "YOUR_PRODUCT_KEY"
	# Initialize a Client Instance by product_key
	client = pybagel.Client(product_key=product_key)
	
	# Register a device_key by client
	client.registerDevice()


#### - Connecting custom properties or events
In your device application, you will need to prepare your report before sending it to MoBagel.

* Determining different states of your devices to send along with your report

		# Example states

		"state": "normal"
		"state": "error"

* Adding custom properties or events with a key beginning with c_

		# Example custom properties or events

		"c_temperature": 30
		"c_event": "turned_on"
* Deciding when to send reports (time, frequency, events)


#### - Sending first report
Once you connect the sensor properties, you can generate a report with the sendReport function.

    # Sample report
	device_key = "YOUR_DEVICE_KEY"
	content = {
	            "state": "Put your state here!",
	            "c_customization" : "python_sdk_test",
	            "c_develop_zone" : "PythonSDK"
	        }
	
	# SendReport
	code, content = client.sendReport(
	    device_key=device_key,
	    content=content
	)
	client.sendReport(device_key, content)
